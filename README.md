This repository includes a Jupyter notebook as well as three datasets. I read two of the datasets in the Jupyter notebook and write the third. The Jupyter notebook produces a datasets which I visualize <a href="https://grahambearden.shinyapps.io/tfa_example/">here in a Shiny dashboard</a>.

These data derive from an actual dataset. All observations are masked. No individuals can be identified from any data in the dataset.
